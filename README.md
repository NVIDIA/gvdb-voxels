NVIDIA® GVDB VOXELS

Release 1.1.1

## OVERVIEW
NVIDIA® GVDB Voxels is a new library and SDK for simulation, compute, and rendering of sparse volumetric data. Details on the GVDB technology can be found at [http://developer.nvidia.com/gvdb](http://developer.nvidia.com/gvdb).

## RELEASE NOTES

1/29/2020, GVDB Voxels 1.1.1

* Significantly streamlined CMake build system
* gImportVDB Linux support
* Uses surface and texture objects instead of surface and texture references

## SAMPLE USAGE
All interactive samples use the following user interface:

* Camera rotation -> move mouse
* Change orientation -> left mouse click

* Zoom -> right mouse click

* Panning -> hold middle button

A few samples have on-screen GUIs with features that can be toggled by clicking on them.

## QUICK BUILD PROCESS (Windows and Linux)

### Install dependencies
  1. Install [CMake 3.10](https://cmake.org/download/) or later.
  2. Install [CUDA Toolkit 10.2](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) or later.

### To build the samples and the library at the same time:

3. In CMake, configure and generate the build system using gvdb-voxels/CMakeLists.txt, then build the `BUILD_ALL` target in your IDE (such as Visual Studio).

That's it!

You can also build a specific sample or the GVDB library this way by building its target in this project. Additionally, you can collect a build of GVDB and its samples into a redistributable package by building the `INSTALL` target.

(Wondering what the `GVDB_BUILD_OPTIX_SAMPLES`, `GVDB_BUILD_OPENVDB`, `GVDB_BUILD_OPENVDB_SAMPLES`, `GVDB_BUILD_NANOVDB`, and `GVDB_BUILD_NANOVDB` checkboxes in the CMake GUI do? See "To build the OptiX samples", "To build GVDB with OpenVDB", and "To build the NanoVDB sample" below.)

### To build the GVDB Library by itself:

3. In CMake, configure and generate the build system using `gvdb-voxels/source/gvdb_library/CMakeLists.txt`, then build the `gvdb` target.

As above, you can create a redistributable build of the NVIDIA GVDB Voxels library by building the `INSTALL` target.

### To build a sample by itself:

3. In CMake, configure and generate the build system using `gvdb-voxels/source/[your sample name here]/CMakeLists.txt`, then build your sample's target.

That's it! In Visual Studio, you can also run a sample by right-clicking it inside Visual Studio, selecting "Set as StartUp Project", and then pressing F5 or clicking the green triangle in the toolbar.

For some samples, you'll see targets named things like `gSample`, `gSampleApp`, and `gSamplePTX`. In this case, you'll want to build and run `gSample`; the other two targets compile the application and its PTX files, while the `gSample` target collects everything together.

Building a sample will also automatically build GVDB, so you no longer need to build and install GVDB before building a sample.

### To build the OptiX samples:

1. Install OptiX 6.5 from https://developer.nvidia.com/designworks/optix/download.
2. On **Windows**, check `GVDB_BUILD_OPTIX_SAMPLES` in the CMake GUI, or add `-DGVDB_BUILD_OPTIX_SAMPLES=ON` to the CMake command line.
3. On **Linux**, check `GVDB_BUILD_OPTIX_SAMPLES` in the CMake GUI, and also add an entry, `OPTIX_ROOT_DIR`, pointing to the path to the OptiX SDK (the folder containing OptiX's `lib64` directory). Or if you're using the CMake command line, add `-DGVDB_BUILD_OPTIX_SAMPLES=ON -DOPTIX_ROOT_DIR=<path to OptiX SDK>`, replacing `<path to OptiX SDK>` with the correct path.
4. Finally, generate and build the CMake project.

### To build GVDB with OpenVDB:

**Windows:**

1. Install OpenVDB: On Windows, one of the easiest ways to install OpenVDB is to use Microsoft's [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg); install `vcpkg`, then run `vcpkg install openvdb[tools]:x64-windows`. Make sure `vcpkg` is using the same compiler you'll use to compile GVDB!
2. Work around a temporary issue in vcpkg: If you plan to build GVDB in release mode, go to your `vcpkg/installed/x64-windows-debug/bin` folder and copy `openvdb_d.dll` to `openvdb.dll`. This works around an issue where a build system copies debug-mode `openvdb.lib` and `openvdb.dll` to `openvdb_d.lib` and `openvdb_d.dll` respectively, but doesn't update the DLL reference in `openvdb_d.lib`.
3. Configure CMake:
   1. If you're using the **CMake GUI**, delete the cache, then click the "Configure" button, specify your generator and platform, check "Specify toolchain file for cross-compiling", and click "Next". Then specify the path to `vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake`, and click Finish. Then check `GVDB_BUILD_OPENVDB` (and if you'd like to build the gImportVDB sample as well, check `GVDB_BUILD_OPENVDB_SAMPLES`) and click "Configure" again.
   2. If you're using the **CMake command line**, you can also do this by specifying `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<path to vcpkg.cmake> -DGVDB_BUILD_OPENVDB=ON -DGVDB_BUILD_OPENVDB_SAMPLES=ON`.
   3. Alternatively, if you're not using `vcpkg`, you can also specify `GVDB_OPENVDB_INCLUDE_DIR`, `GVDB_OPENVDB_LIB_RELEASE_DIR`, `GVDB_OPENVDB_LIB_DEBUG_DIR`, and `GVDB_OPENVDB_DLL_RELEASE_DIR` and copy in OpenVDB's DLLs using any method - see `gvdb_library/CMakeLists.txt` for more information.
4. Finally, generate and build the CMake project. Now you can run GVDB with OpenVDB!

**Linux:**

1. Install OpenVDB 6.1+: On Linux, we recommend building OpenVDB from source using the instructions on [OpenVDB's Developer Quick Start](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openvdb/#linux), unless OpenVDB 6.1+ is available through your distro's package manager (6.1 introduced a new CMake build system in OpenVDB that we rely upon). Note that you may have to add `-DCMAKE_NO_SYSTEM_FROM_IMPORTED:BOOL=TRUE` if you run into OpenVDB [Issue 144](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openvdb/issues/144#issuecomment-508984426).
2. Configure CMake:
   1. If you're using the **CMake GUI**, check `GVDB_BUILD_OPENVDB` and `GVDB_BUILD_OPENVDB_SAMPLES` and click "Configure" again.
   2. If you're using the **CMake command line**, you can also do this by specifying `-DGVDB_BUILD_OPENVDB=ON -DGVDB_BUILD_OPENVDB_SAMPLES=ON`.
3. Finally, generate and build the CMake project. Now you can run GVDB with OpenVDB!

### To build the NanoVDB sample:

1. Download NanoVDB from the OpenVDB repository at https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openvdb/tree/feature/nanovdb/nanovdb. Since NanoVDB is a header-only library, there's no need to build OpenVDB.
2. In CMake, set `GVDB_NANOVDB_INCLUDE_DIR` to the path to NanoVDB (this folder contains a `nanovdb` folder which contains `NanoVDB.h`), set `GVDB_BUILD_NANOVDB` to `ON`, and set `GVDB_BUILD_NANOVDB_SAMPLES` to `ON`.
3. Finally, generate and build the CMake project. Now you can run the `gNanoVDB` sample!
